As Shown in lab we have 6 (columns) by 10 (rows) chip trays that need to be selected. |
The goal is to make a selecton table in the current html, and link it to the python. 


Requirments:
* 6 x 10
* Must be able to select single chips or multiple (may be scattered)
* Each selection will update a json varible (dictionary or array conversion probably). (If you do array keep selection order, dict you can ignore that)
    - Array
    - {
        {0,2},
        {2,5},
        {row, col} 
    - }
    - Dictionary
    - {
    "row1": {"col1": 3, "col2": 0, "col4": 5},
    "row2": {"col1": 1, "col3": 4, "col6": 2},
    "row3": {"col1": 5, "col2": 2, "col3": 0}
    - }
* A button to send selection packet (Ill handle this or make requirments for this later)


Extra:
* If you want to get fancy, full select rows, columns, and all
