?? Motors may need thread LOCK protocol while working ?? 


APP::

Raspi:
set static ip for raspi
sudo nmtui


setup Tape Motor
MotorControllers needs to be rubuilt slightly woth a MotorStep();, so tape motor can run not blocking, also not sure why but Tape send does not run the tape motor


Can you clean up Tape Motor Inputs

Can you add flashing E stop button, with please "Restart Machine"
