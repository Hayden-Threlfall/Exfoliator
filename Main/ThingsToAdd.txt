Estop button
Estop buffer serial send and send to python
Json sending to python
String recieving (consider json recieving...) from python
// Might need a buffer array for string data to handle string being sent to fast (UGHHHHHHHHHH) [Will TCP string ever be skipped later question, based on the protocol noooo]
    this would also require a handle request like threading potentiallllly prbably mostly for motors.... Not sure if I should add this may stay as an IDEA
